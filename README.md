# Acknowledgements and Notes

Jerry-Bot was designed for the Cognitive Systems course Cogs 300 (Understanding and Designing Cognitive Systems) in a team 4. Most of the setup and framework was provided in the course lab file. Teams were also provided with the scrips for CogsAgent and WorldConstant, as well as most of the assets and prefabs.

The bulk of our group work can be found in the Group_Project_Team_2.cs file, where we implemented reinforcement learning through a series of iterations via the unity ML-Agents toolkit. Robot behaviour was also captured using generated adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) as well.

Jerry-Bot was designed with 3 strategies. 
- Seek out and retreive one item at a time 
- Upon contact with an enemy, fire the laser
- With 60 seconds remaining, shift focus to stealing all items from enemy base
